    <p><h4>Policy: </h4><div class="incident_box" id="description"></div></p>

    <!-- You require very complex passwords that are impossible to memorize and you ask people to
        change them every month. On the other hand password recovery needs to go through a manned
        helpdesk. -->

    <p><h4>Incident: </h4><div class="incident_box" id="event"></div></p>
    <!--
    <p>Jessica, a Business Analyst at a utility company, needs to urgently share a large volume of files
        with colleagues in her department as part of a high priority task she is undertaking. These files
        contain “Confidential” company information for “internal use only”. Jessica has made the
        files available through Microsoft SharePoint, restricting access to certain team members.</p>

    <p>Some team members tell her they cannot access the files due to infrequent use and forgotten
        passwords. Jessica knows from past experience that it may
        take up to 3 hours for the administrator to approve the pasword resetting procedure. If these files
        are not made
        available within the next 30 minutes, this will severely impact delivery and quality.</p>

    <p>As not all of her colleagues require access to all the files, to manually distribute them would
        involve her identifying the subset of files for each person - this will be a very time-consuming
        task, so Jessica creates an archive of all the relevant documents and considers
        how best to deliver it to the group.</p>
    -->
    <p><h4>Consequences: </h4><div class="incident_box" id="consequences"></div></p>

    <!-- Jessica requests that those that have entered the system and accessed the files share
        their (main log-in) account details and
        passwords with those without to allow them access to the information.
